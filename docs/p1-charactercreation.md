# Character Creation #

Players start with X amount of EXP which they can use to buy attributes, skills, etc.



## Buy Costs ##

LVL refers to the current points in the skill/attribute/ability. For example, if the cost is 40XP * LEVEL, then going to 1 point costs 40 but going to 2 costs 80.


| Purchase      | Cost |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Skill         | 40XP * LVL  |
| Ability       | 50XP * LVL  |
| Energy        | 10XP * LVL  |
| Health/Sanity | 20XP * LVL  |



## Limits ##

- Skills are capped at out 3 points.
- Attributes are capped at 6.



## Player Defined Skills ##

Players have a limited number of player-defined skills they can use. If players define these skills at character creation, then they start the skill at 1 point for 40XP.

If players define these skills later during the adventure, the skill starts at 0 points (meaning they can use the skill but not gain any bonuses) for 40XP.

During character creation, if you choose a very narrow or specific skill, you might gain some bonuses. Example: picking something oddly specific like neurosurgery might gain you extra skill points vs something more common and usable like stealth.
