### Roll System ###

This game uses a success based roll system. You roll a pool of dice and count up how many dice are equal to or less than some number. Each dice that does counts as a success. The more successes you roll, the better you do.


**Attributes** - Characters have 7 attributes to represent physical and mental traits. Each action will use one of these attributes. The attribute score a target number for what is considered a success. For every dice that rolls this number *or less*, you'll get one success.


**Skills** - Adds a bonus to an attribute when you do an particular action. For example, having the Lockpicking skill will give you an additional bonus when you try to lockpick, on top of your dexterity attribute. A skill is limited to 3.

There are 2 types of skills:

- Combat Skills: A list of pre-determined skills that are typically used in combat. 
- User-defined skills: Players can come up with their own skills to be used throughout the adventure. There are a limited number of these skills. These can be defined at character creation or later during the adventure (at a penalty)


**Energy** - This determines the number of dice in your current dice pool. For every action, you roll this amount of dice.

**Fatigue** - As you do actions, your character gets tired and gains fatigue. As fatigue increases, you begin to reduce the number of dice in your dice pool. Every 10 fatigue means you get 1 less dice in your dice pool.


**Resources** - Sometimes, if you do an action with an item, it may consume resources. Examples such as durability for melee weapons or ammo for ranged weapons.

<br/><br/>

#### Example Roll ####

1. Player tries to lift a heavy object.
2. Player has 4 strength and 10 energy. This means they roll 10 dice and for every dice that is 4 or less, you get 1 success.
3. Player has 22 fatigue. This means you reduce the number of dice in the pool by 2 (22 / 10 = 2, ignoring the remainder).
4. So a player will roll 8 dice. Then they count successes.

### Others ###

**Health** - When this goes to 0, you die.

**Sanity** - When this goes to 0, you go insane.

**XP** - You can buy stats or attributes with EXP. See the Character Creation page for more details.




### Items and Slots ###

This system relies heavily on your items for combat.

Your character will have an inventory and an equipped items section. You can only use items that you have equipped, otherwise you have to equip it from your inventory.

Inventory and Equipped Items are limited to a number of slots. You can increase these slots as needed.

### Roll Options ###

There are some options you can add to your character through the status bar at the bottom of the sheet.

- **Bonus Rolls**: Add additional rolls to your pool.

- **Roll Cost**: Changes the amount of fatigue you gain for each action. Default is 3.

- **Roll Type**: Sets rolls to be active or free. If it's free it won't add any fatigue, otherwise, it will add fatigue equal to your Roll Cost
